# This script is used to update the DNS record for a domain name using the GoDaddy API.
# It is intended to be run as a cron job every 5 minutes.

# Set the API key and secret for the GoDaddy API.
# You can obtain these from the GoDaddy developer portal.
# https://developer.godaddy.com/

# Before running this script, you must ensure that you have a public IP address. 
# To check if your current IP address is a public IPï¼š
#   1. Log into your router and check the external IP address displayed by the router. 
#   2. Visit https://www.ip138.com to check your IP address.
# If both IP addresses are the same, it means you have a public IP; otherwise, it is a private IP.
